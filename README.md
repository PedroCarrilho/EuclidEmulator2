# EuclidEmulator2 (version 2.0)
This repository contains the main source code of the EuclidEmulator2, a fast and accurate tool to estimate the non-linear correction to the matter power spectrum. 
In contrast to its predecessor EuclidEmulator, EuclidEmulator2 allows 8-parameter cosmological models including massive neutrinos (assuming a degenerate hierarchy)
and dynamical dark energy.
