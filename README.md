# EuclidEmulator2 (version 1.0)
This repository contains the source code of EuclidEmulator2, a fast and accurate tool to estimate the non-linear correction to the matter power spectrum. 
In contrast to its predecessor EuclidEmulator, EuclidEmulator2 allows for 8-parameter cosmological models including massive neutrinos (assuming a degenerate hierarchy) and dynamical dark energy. EuclidEmulator2 is written in C++. For more information on EuclidEmulator please visit https://github.com/miknab/EuclidEmulator.

## Currently implemented features
* emulation of the non-linear correction factor <i>B(k,z)</i>
* large allowd redshift interval: <i>z</i> in the interval [0.0,10.0] 
* spatial scales spanning more than three orders of magnitude: 8.73 x 10<sup>-3</sup> <i>h</i> / Mpc ≤ <i>k</i> ≤ 9.41 <i>h</i> / Mpc.

* C++ executable
* many different was to define the cosmologies:
  - direct definition of a single cosmology using command line parameters </li>
  - definition of several cosmologies through a parameter file </li>
  - definition of a cosmology through a CLASS or CAMB parameter file </li>
* results are written to output file

For a more extensive list of functionalities please the list of possible command line parameters shown [below](#building-and-installation).

## Features yet to be implemented
* resolution correction emulator
* pip-installable python3 wrapper
* allow customization of output <i>k</i> modes

## Quick start
### Prerequisites
In any case you need:
 * C++11 or later
 * GNU Scientific Library version 2.5 or higher (GSL; see https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
 * g++ version 4.9.1 or higher
 
### Test installations
The code was successfully compiled on the following systems and environments:

* Mac OS X Mojave (10.14.6), with g++ version 9.3.0 and GSL version 2.6 (both g++ and GSL were installed with Homebrew)
* Linux (Red Hat 4.4.7-18), with g++ version 4.9.1 and GSL version 2.5

 
### Get the code
If you have not done so already, either download this repository or clone it to your local host (under Linux you can get a gzipped tar-ball via
```
   wget https://github.com/miknab/EuclidEmulator2/archive/master.tar.gz
```

### Building and installation
The current version of EuclidEmulator2 comes as a command line interface (CLI). In order to build it, cd into the EuclidEmulator2 directory, check the `Makefile` and modify it as required (in particular the path of the `-I` and `-L` flag for GSL) and execute 

```
   make
```
This will create an executable file called `ee2.exe`. In order to check if the build was successful, execute

```
   ./ee2.exe --help
```

You should now see the following output:

```
Highly accurate and efficient AI-based predictor of the non-linear correction of the matter power spectrum.
Usage:
  EuclidEmulator2 [OPTION...]

  -b, --Omega_b arg    baryon density parameter
  -m, --Omega_m arg    (total) matter density parameter
  -s, --Sum_m_nu arg   sum of neutrino masses in eV
  -n, --n_s arg        spectral index
  -H, --hubble arg     dimensionless Hubble parameter
  -W, --w_0 arg        time-independent dark energy equation-of-state
                       parameter
  -w, --w_a arg        time-dependent dark energy equation-of-state parameter
  -A, --A_s arg        spectral amplitude
  -z, --redshift arg   redshift at which the NLC shall be computed
  -i, --inifile arg    path to CLASS or CAMB parameter file
  -p, --parfile arg    path to EE2 parameter file
  -o, --outfile arg    output file name (default: nlc)
  -d, --outdir arg     output directory (default: results)
  -v, --verbosity arg  verbosity level (0, 1 or 2) (default: 0)
  -h, --help           Print usage
```

### Sanity check
As a next step I recommend to go through the following:

  1. enter the EuclidEmulator2 directory (root level). Here you should see, amongst others, a `tests` directory and a `results` directory. If you have just freshly built the code, the `results` directory should be empty.
  2. execute the command `./tests/run_test.sh`
 
You should now see some output printed to screen that provides information about the cosmologies that are being treated by EuclidEmulator2. As a result, the following files should now be in the `results` directory:

```
  CAMB_example0.dat
  CLASS_example0.dat
  cmd_input_test.dat0.dat
  from_ee2_parfile0.dat
  from_ee2_parfile1.dat
  from_ee2_parfile2.dat
  from_ee2_parfile3.dat
```

In each file you should find a list of k modes (first column) and one or more B(k,z) column.

### Usage
There are several ways of calling EuclidEmulator2. The different options are briefly explained in the following:

* specify a cosmology directly by passing a value for each cosmological parameter (flags `-b, -m, -s, -n, -H, -W, -w, -A` and `-z` as well as there corresponding long versions). Notice that an arbitrary number of redshifts (`-z` flags) can be passed:

Example:
```
    ./ee2.exe -b 0.049 -m 0.319 -s 0.058 -n 0.96 -H 0.67 -W -1.0 -w 0.0 -A 2.1e-9\
              -z 0.0 -z 0.1081179 -z 0.4880429
```

* using the `-p` flag to pass an EuclidEmulator2 parameter file that contains at least one cosmology.

Example:
```
    ./ee2.exe -p tests/ee2_parfile.par
```

Checkout the file `tests/ee2_parfile.par` in order to learn more about how to structure such a parameter file.

* using the `-i` flag to pass a `CLASS` or `CAMB` parameter file.

Examples:
```
    ./ee2.exe -i tests/camb_parameter_file.ini -t CAMB
```
or
```
    ./ee2.exe -i tests/class_parameter_file.ini -t CLASS
```
