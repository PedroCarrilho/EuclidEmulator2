# EuclidEmulator2 (version 2.0)
This repository contains the source code of EuclidEmulator2, a fast and accurate tool to estimate the non-linear correction to the matter power spectrum. 
In contrast to its predecessor EuclidEmulator, EuclidEmulator2 allows for 8-parameter cosmological models including massive neutrinos (assuming a degenerate hierarchy) and dynamical dark energy. EuclidEmulator2 is written in C++. For more information on EuclidEmulator please visit https://github.com/miknab/EuclidEmulator.

## Currently implemented features
* emulation of the non-linear correction factor <i>B(k,z)</i>
* large allowd redshift interval: <i>z</i> in the interval [0.0,10.0] 
* spatial scales spanning more than three orders of magnitude: 8.73 x 10<sup>-3</sup> <i>h</i> / Mpc ≤ <i>k</i> ≤ 9.41 <i>h</i> / Mpc.

* C++ executable
* many different was to define the cosmologies:
  - direct definition of a single cosmology using command line parameters </li>
  - definition of several cosmologies through a parameter file </li>
  - definition of a cosmology through a CLASS or CAMB parameter file </li>
* results are written to output file

For a more extensive list of functionalities please the list of possible command line parameters shown [below](#building-and-installation).

## Features yet to be implemented
* resolution correction emulator
* pip-installable python3 wrapper

## Quick start
### Prerequisites
In any case you need:
 * C++11 or later
 * GNU Scientific Library version 2.5 or higher (GSL; see https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
 * g++ version 4.9.1 or higher
 
### Test installations
The code was successfully compiled on the following systems and environments:

* Mac OS X Mojave (10.14.6), with g++ version 9.3.0 and GSL version 2.6 (both g++ and GSL were installed with Homebrew)
* Linux (Red Hat 4.4.7-18), with g++ version 4.9.1 and GSL version 2.5

 
### Get the code
If you have not done so already, either download this repository or clone it to your local host (under Linux you can get a gzipped tar-ball via
```
   wget https://github.com/miknab/EuclidEmulator2/archive/master.tar.gz
```

### Building and installation
The current version of EuclidEmulator2 comes as a command line interface (CLI). In order to compile it, cd into the EuclidEmulator2 directory, modify the `Makefile` if you want to and execute 

```
   make
```
This will create an executable file called `ee2.exe`. In order to check if the build was successful, execute

```
   ./ee2.exe --help
```

You should now see the following output:

```
Highly accurate and efficient AI-based predictor of the non-linear correction of the matter power spectrum.

### Usage
There are several ways of calling EuclidEmulator2. The different options are briefly explained in the following:

* specify a cosmology directly by passing a value for each cosmological parameter (flags `-b, -m, -s, -n, -H, -W, -w, -A` and `-z` as well as there corresponding long versions). Notice that an arbitrary number of redshifts (`-z` flags) can be passed:

Example:
```
    ./ee2.exe -b 0.049 -m 0.319 -s 0.058 -n 0.96 -H 0.67 -W -1.0 -w 0.0 -A 2.1e-9\
              -z 0.0 -z 0.1081179 -z 0.4880429
```

* using the `-p` flagpass an input file that contains at least one cosmology.

Example:
```
    ./ee2.exe -p tests/test_csm.dat
```

* using the `-i` flag to pass a `CLASS` or `CAMB` parameter file.

Examples:
```
    ./ee2.exe -i tests/camb_parameter_file.ini
```
or
```
    ./ee2.exe -i tests/class_parameter_file.ini
```
